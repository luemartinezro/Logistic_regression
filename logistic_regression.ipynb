    "### What is logistic regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification, meaning a result has two possible values (e.g., yes/no, success/failure, default/no default). It models the probability of a binary outcome (that is, an outcome that can take one of two possible values, typically coded as 0 and 1) based on one or more predictor variables. Where the response default falls into one of two categories, Yes or No. Instead of directly modeling this response $Y$ logistic regression models the probability that $Y$ belongs to a particular category.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When applied to data, logistic regression models the probability of default (non-payment of a debt). Thus, we can use this idea for a financial problem, for example, to predict the probability that a customer will fail to meet their payment obligations, based on specific data, such as the balance of their account. Therefore, the probability of default, given the account balance, can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$Pr(default=yes|balance)$  $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$    (1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The values p(balance), will range between 0 and 1. This means that, for any given account balance, the probability of default can be predicted. For example, one might predict $defaul=Yes$, for any individual for whom $p(balance) > 0.5$. Alternatively, if a company wants to be conservative when predicting individuals at risk of default, it might choose to use a lower threshold, such as  $p(balance) > 0.1$.\n",

    "###  Assumptions of Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a statistical method used to analyze data with binary outcomes (like yes/no or 1/0) and determine the relationship between those outcomes and independent variables. There are several key assumptions for logistic regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Binary Dependent Variable: The method is designed for dependent variables with two categories. If the outcome has more than two categories, other methods like multinomial logistic regression are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Independent Observations: Each data point should be independent of the others, meaning there should be no repeated measurements or clustering within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linearity in the Logit: The relationship between the independent variables and the logit (log-odds) of the dependent variable should be linear. This means that while the outcome itself may not have a linear relationship with the independent variables, the log-odds should.\n",
    "\n",
    "* No Multicollinearity: The independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other. High correlation between variables (multicollinearity) can make the model unstable and hard to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Absence of Outliers: Outliers can significantly influence the model, so it's important to check for and address any outliers that might distort the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adequate Sample Size: Logistic regression requires a reasonably large sample size to ensure reliable parameter estimates. A common guideline is to have at least 10 observations for each independent variable."

Also, if we were to predict very large balances, then, most probably we get values bigger than 1.

    "### The key points defining logistic regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Binary Outcome: The dependent variable (outcome) is binary, meaning it has two possible values. For example, it can represent \"success\" or \"failure,\" \"yes\" or \"no,\" \"true\" or \"false.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Logistic Function: Logistic regression uses the logistic function (also known as the sigmoid function) to model the probability of the binary outcome. The logistic function is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\delta(z)= \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$                 $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$    (6)\n",
    "\n",
    "where $z$ is the linear combination of the predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Linear Combination of Predictors: The logistic regression model predicts the log-odds of the probability of the outcome as a linear combination of the predictor variables. The model can be expressed as equation (5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $P$ is the probability of the outcome, $\\beta_{0}$ is the intercept, $\\beta_{1}, \\beta_{2}, \\beta_{i}$ are the coeficients of the predictor variables $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE): The coefficients of the model are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation, which finds the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of observing the given data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Interpretation of Coefficients: The coefficients in a logistic regression model can be interpreted in terms of odds ratios. For a given predictor variable $X_{i}$, the coefficient $\\beta_{i}$, represents the change in the log-odds of the outcome for a one-unit change in $X_{i}$, holding all other predictors constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Model Evaluation: Common metrics for evaluating the performance of a logistic regression model include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC-ROC)."
